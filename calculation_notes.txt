Distance between points is calculated via the ‘haversine’ formula for great-circle distance 
between two points – that is, the shortest distance over the earth’s surface.

Haversine formula: 	

a = sin²(Δφ/2) + cos(φ1).cos(φ2).sin²(Δλ/2)
c = 2.atan2(√a, √(1−a))
d = R.c
where 	φ is latitude, λ is longitude, R is earth’s radius (mean radius = 6,371km)
  	note that angles need to be in radians to pass to trig functions!


Thus in the LLUV lattice, the distance between any two adjacent points is:

LATITUDE : 0.1112 km
LONGITUDE: 0.08798 km
