Distance between points is calculated via the ‘haversine’ formula for great-circle distance 
between two points – that is, the shortest distance over the earth’s surface.

Haversine formula: 	

a = sin²(Δφ/2) + cos(φ1).cos(φ2).sin²(Δλ/2)
c = 2.atan2(√a, √(1−a))
d = R.c
where φ is latitude, λ is longitude, R is earth’s radius (mean radius = 6,371km)
  	note that angles need to be in radians to pass to trig functions!

Thus in the LLUV lattice, the distance between any two adjacent points is:

LATITUDE : 0.1112 km
LONGITUDE: 0.08798 km


Conversion of u-v vectors to direction (D) and magnitude (M).

M = sqrt (u**2 + v**2)   where u & v are the component velocities in the ascii file, sqrt is the square root and **2 is a square

D = arctan(v/u) where arctan is the inverse of the tangent function.  The value of D will be in radians (+-pi)


Example cellular automaton calculation sequence:

STICKY THE STICK is dropped at point (37.820, -122.465), where the prevailing vector is:

    U (ew) = 7.6946000e+01  
    V (ns) = -1.5476000e+01
    
Calculating, we get a magnitude and direction of:

    Mag = 78.48690012989428
    Dir = 1.7692763277322927

?? So how do we figure out the next point we reach?
